# senpi
Senpi is a series of Python scripts designed to allow users to control their Raspberry Pi (and connected devices) using voice recognition. It is designed to be easy to add new functions by dropping in new scripts and making small modifications to the senpi.py script file.

senpi.py is the main script. It activates always-on voice activation and by default listens for the keyword "Senpai". Commands should be structured to fit as much information as possible into one line- in other words, "Senpai turn on the speaker" should be parsed as one command (Speaker > On). Optimally, add-in scripts should be able to use voice recognition to allow "pulse" commands ("Senpi. "Yes?" Send a message to Bill. "What should I send?" Hello"), although the script is designed to work best with single commands ("Senpi, send a message to Bill that says Hello").

Senpi uses [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/) by Anthony Zhang, and [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/), and is based off a sample program by SpeechRecognition creator Anthony Zhang.
